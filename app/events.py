"""In-memory event bus for real-time dashboard updates (Phase 6).

Provides a thread-safe publish/subscribe mechanism so background pipeline
tasks, RSVP polls, and reminder sends can push events to connected SSE
clients in real time.

Design:
- publish_event(event_type, data, organization_id) — thread-safe, callable
  from sync background tasks (pipeline runs in BackgroundTasks which may
  execute in a thread).  Accepts an optional organization_id so the event
  can be scoped to a single tenant.
- subscribe(organization_id) — returns an asyncio.Queue for an SSE client;
  the queue receives JSON-encoded event strings.  When organization_id is
  provided, only events for that organization are delivered.
- MAX_QUEUE_SIZE prevents a slow client from growing unbounded memory.

SSE endpoint is in dashboard.py; this module is the bus only.
